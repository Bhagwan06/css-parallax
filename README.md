# CSS Parallax Project

This project demonstrates a parallax scrolling effect using HTML and CSS. It consists of multiple sections with different background images, where each section scrolls at a different speed compared to the rest of the page, creating a parallax effect.

## Features

- **Smooth Parallax Effect**: Each background image is fixed while the content scrolls, creating a dynamic visual experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across devices.
- **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover effects on the section titles add a modern and engaging user experience.
